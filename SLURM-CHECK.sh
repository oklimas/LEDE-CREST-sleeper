# LEGEND of statuses
# 0 -> Error of this script.
# 1 -> Unknown Time of start. The time hasn't been assigned yet, so 
# pending.
# 2 -> Pending.
# 3 -> Running.
# 4 -> Completed.
# 5 -> Invalid ID, which means Completed. scontrol removes the job from
# its history after a short moment after completion.
